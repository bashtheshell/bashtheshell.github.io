This is a Jekyll blog site created using Michael Rose's marvelous [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) theme. I previously hosted my blog on Wordpress.com and migrated to the GitHub platform. The top reasons are the convenience of using Markdown and being able to use code blocks without the messy quote issues Wordpress.com couldn't handle. As a bonus, I can maintain my `git` skill that I couldn't do with Wordpress.com.
