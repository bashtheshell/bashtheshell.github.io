For little over a year, I've been longing for a better blogging platform to host my blog. I was hosting my blog on Wordpress.com, and I really liked the convenient of working with it directly from the browser until I started posting code snippets containing `<` or `>`. It'd keep changing to `&lt;` and `&gt;`, respectively. Even shameless Wordpress admitted [this behavior](https://codex.wordpress.org/Writing_Code_in_Your_Posts).

All hell broke loose every time. I had to resort to a very unpleasant workaround. I'd have to find the correct code tags in the HTML post-editor rather than the reader-friendly Wordpress post-editor and paste the original code within tags. I had to save the edit while I was in the HTML mode in order to get what I wanted the world to see. Ridiculously enough, the published post would break again each time I attempt to "edit", even without making or saving modification. I cringed every time I inevitably had to revisit the Wordpress post-editor to update my post, and I finally called it quit after publishing my fifth technical post.

I have knew about Jekyll about a year ago, but admittedly, with a basic HTML/CSS skill, I wasn't able to figure out how to use it yet, let alone the spare time I didn't have to wrestle with it as I was working toward RHCSA certification. Nevertheless, I'm glad I didn't spend too much with Jekyll then as I did now as I don't think I'd be able to obtain the certification on time.

I learned about Jekyll when I was researching for another absolute-free web hosting (yes, I'm a cheapskate bastard :sweat_smile:). Most sources would point me to GitHub as a viable alternative as most places would expect you to fork over some cash. What I was reading at first has left me fabbergasted as I couldn't understand how it's even possible for GitHub to become a web-hosting. From there, I also learned GitHub is also powered by Jekyll. I realized my knowledge gap was really showing as I didn't know Git or Markdown either, which ultimately became the reason I deferred my blog migration for so long.

You may wonder why I didn't self-host Wordpress.org at home. For one, I don't have a spare server. Sure I could purchase a cheap Raspberry Pi to host it, but it'd not be a smart thing to do. Maintaining security and availability also come to mind, and that's not my cup of tea when I'm at home. I can achieve more in life by doing less, having someone who is paid to set up my server, allowing me to focus on what matters the most. IMHO, public-facing self-hosting at home is a colossal waste of time for an individual.

Jekyll introduced me to a whole new landscape as I was just absorbing the difference between static and dynamic websites. I can appreciate how quickly the site loads with Jekyll due to its static contents without a database slowing it down while fetching data. When I was ready to use Jekyll, I referred to their [documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/) and followed the steps in order. I realized I have to be extremely patient with myself as I wouldn't understand it better until I get Jekyll to run on my server and play with it. I truly learn best by doing.

I now embrace Jekyll with all of my heart. Thanks to it, I'm now more active on GitHub, picked up some Markdown, using `git` more, and most importantly, more motivated than ever to make new posts. I also want to give a shout-out to [Michael Rose](https://mademistakes.com/about/) for his outstanding contribution to the Jekyll community, shipping beautiful themes along with well-written documentations, which helped me tremendously. I hope to post a 'how-to' installation guide for CentOS 7 in the near future, so you can locally test your web content. Please visit again soon.
